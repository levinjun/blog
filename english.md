##相互理解，才能一起生活  
###英文  
Sherry is in her **internship** now. Last month, she bought a **lipstick** which she really liked.

This lipstick cost her more than 50 dollars. It's not cheap, but it made her happy, because it was the one that she had been **longing** for a long time.

Every morning, when she puts on her **makeup**, everything seems **brand new** due to this lipstick. It feels like that the whole day is full of hope.

Sherry has long been **accustomed** to **rewarding** herself through shopping.

And this **desire for** **material possession** drives her to work hard.

She feels good about this. Her life keeps getting better all because of this kind of desire.

But her mother thinks quite differently.

Several days ago, Sherry went back to live with her parents for a while. After her mother **came to know** the price of the lipstick, they had kept **quarreling**  for almost a whole day.

Her mother thought that it was completely **immoral** to spend money like this, while Sherry thought her mother was totally **beyond reasoning**.

What Sherry didn't know was that this woman standing in front of her had once been a little girl who had grown up in **poverty** and **starvation**.

That little girl could not find enough clothes to wear in winter. And those little **desserts** you see through the shop windows were something from another world for her.

That girl needed to learn how to spend every penny as if it were two so that she could **survive**.

It's just natural that two people can't understand each other, even for mother and daughter, because everybody's **experience** is different.

Try to be **patient** to the people around you. Try to get to know them. Try to stand in their shoes.

If you can not listen to people, how can you expect them to listen to you?
